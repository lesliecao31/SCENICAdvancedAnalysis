Unbiased analysis of integrated data with Seurat. Analyis must be done post quality control: [visit the tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.2/pbmc3k_tutorial)
and post integration: [visit the tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.2/immune_alignment)

This workflow will:
- Use singleR to investigate celltypes in a dataset
- 

The second half of this workflow will:
- Integrate and recluster celltypes in order to investigate changes on a more granular level. Perform all analyses that were done on the global scale on each subcluster as well as create volcano plots.

If you would like to see the outputs of this analysis, they are available at: [Biernaskie lab dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ntabbv6rzb431um/AADFXA1voHhXvqK7dEqApYQEa?dl=0)
