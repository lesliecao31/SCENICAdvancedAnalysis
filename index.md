SCENIC performs gene-regulatory network inference: [familiarize yourself with SCENIC](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4463). This analysis must be run after intalling and running SCENIC on dataset and is specific to Seurat objects: [visit the installation tutorial](https://rawcdn.githack.com/aertslab/SCENIC/701cc7cc4ac762b91479b3bd2eaf5ad5661dd8c2/inst/doc/SCENIC_Setup.html), [visit the SCENIC tutorial](https://rawcdn.githack.com/aertslab/SCENIC/0a4c96ed8d930edd8868f07428090f9dae264705/inst/doc/SCENIC_Running.html#scenic_workflow)


This workflow will:
- Use singleR to investigate celltypes in a dataset
- 

The second half of this workflow will:
- Integrate and recluster celltypes in order to investigate changes on a more granular level. Perform all analyses that were done on the global scale on each subcluster as well as create volcano plots.

If you would like to see the outputs of this analysis, they are available at: [Biernaskie lab dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ntabbv6rzb431um/AADFXA1voHhXvqK7dEqApYQEa?dl=0)
